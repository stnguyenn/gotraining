This guide assumes an audience with no prior experience in software development. It seeks to leverage Go ecosystem for learning process.

## What is Go

Go is a computer language that focuses on simplicity and efficient toolings.

It aims to provide _frictionless_ application development experience.

## Installation

The side benefit of understanding the installation steps is to become more familiar with your local filesystem.

## Basic Syntax

It is helpful to be aware of the following samples, not to dwell too long in it, but rather keep revisiting as needed.

- https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

## Basic Project Structure

We (should) use someone else's code more often than writing our own. Go-module structure is the industry standard for Go code-sharing.

## Essential Unix/Linux Commands

It is critical that developers know their way around the command line, or
Terminal, as it is sometimes called. The following links aim to guide the
reader to gain an essential understanding of core commands.

### Piping Unix Commands Together (leveraging stdin and stdout)

## CLI (command line interface)

Command-line-interface is the most basic (and common) form of application. Cobra/Viper is a popular library for building CLI.

## Git

Successful software development is rarely accomplished alone. GIT is an important SVC tool (yet another CLI :) to help facilitate development process for multiple individuals.
